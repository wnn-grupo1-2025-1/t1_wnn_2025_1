Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients   
cepstral - spectral   
time signal $\Rightarrow$ Fourier transform $\phantom { 0 } \mathrm { - } >$ frequency spectrum Fs

# MFCC  

Mel scale - scale that relates the perceived frequency of a tone to the actual measured frequency  

$$
( f ) = 2 5 9 5 \log \left( 1 + { \frac { \ l } { 7 } } \right.
$$  

‚óè Filter banks - Representation of the signal obtained after dividing the audio into slices, forming bandpass filters, which are excited by the original signal. MFCC - Cepstral obtained from filter banks
